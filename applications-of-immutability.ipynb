An alternate approach *could* have been to simply build the hash table using the memory address of the each element rather than its value. However, this approach begins to fall apart as soon as strings are used as elements: after the statements `k = \"abc!\"` and `d = {\"abc!\": 123}`, a programmer probably expects `d[k] == 123` to be `True` even though the address of the string instance `\"abc!\"` in `k = \"abc!\"` is *different* from the address of the distinct string instance `\"abc\"` in `d = {\"abc!\": 123}`.

This has most of the benefits of the first approach above, but gives you more control over the interface of the data structure. This is useful if you would like to add custom methods, to modify how certain default methods inherited from the built-in type behave, to [enforce type or value constraints on method arguments](https://github.com/python-supply/static-checking-via-metaclasses), to throw application-specific exceptions, or simply to provide more user-friendly and application-specific synonyms for existing functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A third approach is to define a brand new class that conceals its internal representation. This has the benefit of encapsulation (allowing you to modify the internal representation of the actual route in the future), but requires a more careful approach on the conceptual side and more boilerplate code on the practical side."

    "2. If you would like to ensure that it is not possible to modify or extend an instance of your class once it has been created, you will need to redefine specific methods and attributes in a particular way. However, it is worth noting that this approach does not enforce immutability to the same extent as the approach of defining a class derived from an immutable type.\n",

    "To satisfy the first requirement, it is sufficient to provide definitions for the [`__hash__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__) and [`__eq__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__) methods. The Python interpreter will invoke these methods when building a hash table (*e.g.*, for a `set` or `dict` instance) as well as when retrieving a value. The `__eq__` method is required in addition to the `__hash__` method because hashes are not guaranteed to be unique and the interpreter needs to be able to disambiguate between objects of your class in such scenarios. Note that the Python interpreter expects that two values that are equal according to `__eq__` must have the same hash values according to `__hash__`."

    "Note that in the definition of the `__hash__` method, a cryptographic hash function `sha256` from the built-in [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) library is applied to a string version of a normalized representation (*i.e.*, sorted and deduplicated) of a route. Normalization ensures that the order and multiplicity of edges does not change the hash of a route. Use of `sha256` ensures that the hash of any instance of the same string will always be the same in any environment and under any version of Python. This is not guaranteed by the built-in [`hash`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash) function, which may return different results across different Python sessions (even in the same environment). Such an inconsistency could be an issue if, for example, users of your data structure store instances of it on disk and load them again at a later time."

    "This article provides an overview of the distinction between mutable and immutable data structures in Python, why the distinction exists, and guidance on what options are available to a programmer when they are implementing an application-specific immutable data structure. The information about the [`namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) factory function in the built-in [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) library may be relevant to some scenarios. The third-party [attrs](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/) library can help reduce the amount of boilerplate required to define new classes (even if you are not relying on inheritance) and has features that help introduce [immutability](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#attr.attr.frozen). To learn more about the nuances of object and memory management within the Python interpreter, you can read about [interning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern). Those more familiar with C may find it useful to explore the [Memory Management](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html) documentation (targeting primarily at readers who are interested in implementing their own extensions to the Python interpreter)."
